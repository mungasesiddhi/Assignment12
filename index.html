   <div class="history">
    The city was known as Bhinar in early Yadava times. It was conquered by Malik Aḥmad Niẓām Shah, founder of the Niẓām Shāhī dynasty, in 1490. The city was later taken by the Mughals, the Marathas, and the British. Chief among its historical sites are Aḥmad Niẓām Shah’s fort, in which Jawaharlal Nehru was imprisoned by the British in the 1940s, and the Mughal palace and gardens.
